# Code of Conduct

One of Smile's strengths is our community. To push Smile to amazing new levels,
we rely on an open, friendly, inclusive environment to facilitate this.
As such, we follow the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/)'s
[Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.md)
to ensure a harassment-free experience in the Smile community.

This applies to the main Smile repo, forum, twitter, and all channels.
