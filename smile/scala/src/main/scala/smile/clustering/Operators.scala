  /** Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. This method
    * seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters in a bottom up approach: each
    * observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as
    * one moves up the hierarchy. The results of hierarchical clustering are
    * usually presented in a dendrogram.
    *
    * In general, the merges are determined in a greedy manner. In order to decide
    * which clusters should be combined, a measure of dissimilarity between sets
    * of observations is required. In most methods of hierarchical clustering,
    * this is achieved by use of an appropriate metric, and a linkage criteria
    * which specifies the dissimilarity of sets as a function of the pairwise
    * distances of observations in the sets.
    *
    * Hierarchical clustering has the distinct advantage that any valid measure
    * of distance can be used. In fact, the observations themselves are not
    * required: all that is used is a matrix of distances.

  /** K-Means clustering. The algorithm partitions n observations into k clusters in which
    * each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
    * Although finding an exact solution to the k-means problem for arbitrary
    * input is NP-hard, the standard approach to finding an approximate solution
    * (often called Lloyd's algorithm or the k-means algorithm) is used widely
    * and frequently finds reasonable solutions quickly.
    *
    * However, the k-means algorithm has at least two major theoretic shortcomings:
    *
    *  - First, it has been shown that the worst case running time of the
    * algorithm is super-polynomial in the input size.
    *  - Second, the approximation found can be arbitrarily bad with respect
    * to the objective function compared to the optimal learn.
    *
    * In this implementation, we use k-means++ which addresses the second of these
    * obstacles by specifying a procedure to initialize the cluster centers before
    * proceeding with the standard k-means optimization iterations. With the
    * k-means++ initialization, the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution
    * that is O(log k) competitive to the optimal k-means solution.
    *
    * We also use k-d trees to speed up each k-means step as described in the filter
    * algorithm by Kanungo, et al.
    *
    * K-means is a hard clustering method, i.e. each sample is assigned to
    * a specific cluster. In contrast, soft clustering, e.g. the
    * Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, assign samples
    * to different clusters with different probabilities.

    * immediately update related centroids). It might be because K-L divergence
    * is very sensitive and the centroids may be significantly changed in each
    * iteration in batch updating rule.
    *
    * Note that this implementation has a little difference from the original
    * paper, in which a weighted Jensen-Shannon divergence is employed as a
    * criterion to assign a randomly-picked sample to a different cluster.
    * However, this doesn't work well in some cases as we experienced probably

  /** Clustering Large Applications based upon RANdomized Search. CLARANS is an

  /** Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies. BIRCH performs

    * quality clustering for a given set of resources (memory and time constraints).

    * builds a CF (clustering feature) tree by a single scan of database.
    * The second step clusters the leaves of CF tree by hierarchical clustering.

  /** Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
    * DBSCAN finds a number of clusters starting from the estimated density
    * distribution of corresponding nodes.
    *
    * DBSCAN requires two parameters: radius (i.e. neighborhood radius) and the
    * number of minimum points required to form a cluster (minPts). It starts
    * with an arbitrary starting point that has not been visited. This point's
    * neighborhood is retrieved, and if it contains sufficient number of points,
    * a cluster is started. Otherwise, the point is labeled as noise. Note that
    * this point might later be found in a sufficiently sized radius-environment
    * of a different point and hence be made part of a cluster.
    *
    * If a point is found to be part of a cluster, its neighborhood is also
    * part of that cluster. Hence, all points that are found within the
    * neighborhood are added, as is their own neighborhood. This process
    * continues until the cluster is completely found. Then, a new unvisited point
    * is retrieved and processed, leading to the discovery of a further cluster
    * of noise.
    *
    * DBSCAN visits each point of the database, possibly multiple times (e.g.,
    * as candidates to different clusters). For practical considerations, however,
    * the time complexity is mostly governed by the number of nearest neighbor
    * queries. DBSCAN executes exactly one such query for each point, and if
    * an indexing structure is used that executes such a neighborhood query
    * in O(log n), an overall runtime complexity of O(n log n) is obtained.
    *
    * DBSCAN has many advantages such as
    *
    *  - DBSCAN does not need to know the number of clusters in the data
    *    a priori, as opposed to k-means.
    *  - DBSCAN can find arbitrarily shaped clusters. It can even find clusters
    *    completely surrounded by (but not connected to) a different cluster.
    *    Due to the MinPts parameter, the so-called single-link effect
    *    (different clusters being connected by a thin line of points) is reduced.
    *  - DBSCAN has a notion of noise.
    *  - DBSCAN requires just two parameters and is mostly insensitive to the
    *    ordering of the points in the database. (Only points sitting on the
    *    edge of two different clusters might swap cluster membership if the
    *    ordering of the points is changed, and the cluster assignment is unique
    *    only up to isomorphism.)
    *
    * On the other hand, DBSCAN has the disadvantages of
    *
    *  - In high dimensional space, the data are sparse everywhere
    *    because of the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, DBSCAN doesn't
    *    work well on high-dimensional data in general.
    *  - DBSCAN does not respond well to data sets with varying densities.
