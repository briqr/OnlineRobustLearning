/**
 * Originally used for data compression, Vector quantization (VQ)
 * allows the modeling of probability density functions by
 * the distribution of prototype vectors. It works by dividing a large set of points
 * (vectors) into groups having approximately the same number of
 * points closest to them. Each group is represented by its centroid
 * point, as in K-Means and some other clustering algorithms.
 * <p>
 * Vector quantization is is based on the competitive learning paradigm,
 * and also closely related to sparse coding models
 * used in deep learning algorithms such as autoencoder.
 * <p>
 * Algorithms in this package also support the <code>partition</code>
 * method for clustering purpose.
